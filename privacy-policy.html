        <li><span><strong>Cookies. </strong></span><span>In order to improve our products or services, we collect data
            by way of "cookies". A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store via your browser on the
            hard drive of your computer or mobile device. There are three main types of cookies:</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li><span><strong>Session cookies</strong></span><span>: specific to a particular visit and limited to sending
              session identifiers (random numbers generated by the server) so you don't have to re-enter information
              when you navigate to a new page or check out. Session cookies are not permanently stored on your device
              and are deleted when the browser closes;</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Persistent cookies</strong></span><span>: record information about your preferences and are
              stored in your browser cache or mobile device; and</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Third party cookies</strong></span><span>: placed by someone other than us which may gather
              data across multiple websites or sessions.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span><strong>How we use cookies.</strong></span><span> We use cookies for the following purposes:</span>
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li><span><strong>Strictly necessary:</strong></span><span>These cookies are essential for you to browse our
              Applications and use its features. The information collected relates to the operation of the Applications
              (e.g. website scripting language and security tokens) and enables us to provide you with the service you
              have requested.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Functionality:</strong></span><span>These cookies remember the choices you have made, for
              example the country you visit our Website from, your language and any changes you have made to text size
              and other parts of the web pages that you can customise to improve your user experience and to make your
              visits more tailored and enjoyable.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Performance/analytics:</strong></span><span>These cookies collect information on how users
              use our Website, for example which pages you visit most often, whether you receive any error messages and
              how you arrived at our Applications. Information collected by these cookies is used only to improve your
              use of our Applications. These cookies are sometimes placed by third party providers of web traffic and
              analysis services. We use Google Analytics. For information on how Google processes and collects your
              information and how you can opt out, please click </span><a
              href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Targeting or advertising</strong></span><span>: These cookies collect information about your
              browsing habits and inferred interests to make advertising more relevant to you. They are also used to
              limit the number of times you see an advert as well as to measure the effectiveness of an advertising
              campaign. These cookies are usually placed by third party advertising networks. They remember the other
              websites you visit and this information is shared with third party organisations, for example
              advertisers.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Social Media:</strong></span><span>These cookies allow users to share our website content on
              social media such as Facebook and Twitter. These cookies are not within our control. Please refer to the
              respective privacy policies of the social media providers for how their cookies work.</span><span>We may
              also automatically collect and store certain information about your interaction with our Applications
              including IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system,
              date/time stamps and related data.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span><strong>Other technologies</strong></span><span>. In addition to cookies, we use some other similar
            technologies as follows:</span></li>
        <ul>
          <li><span><strong>Web Beacons</strong></span><span>: small graphic images included on our Applications or
              emails or those of third parties to provide analytics information.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Social widgets</strong></span><span>: buttons or icons provided by third party social media
              networks which may collect browsing data and will be received by the third party and are controlled by the
              third party.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>SDKs</strong></span><span>: these are mobile application third party software development
              kits used in our apps. They enable us to collect information about app activity and the device it runs
              on.</span></li>
          <li><span><strong>Local shared objects</strong></span><span>: these are sometimes called flash cookies and can
              be stored on your browser. They are used to maintain preferences and usage records.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span><strong>Refusing or deleting cookies.</strong></span><span>Most internet browsers are set up by
            default to accept cookies. However if you want to refuse or delete them (or similar technologies) please
            refer to the help and support area on your browser for instructions on how to block or delete cookies (for
            example: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari). Please note you may not be able to
            take advantage of all the features of our Applications, including certain personalised features, if you
            delete or refuse cookies.</span></li>
        <li><span><strong>Mobile Opt-out</strong></span><span>. If you access our Applications through mobile devices,
            you can enable a "do not track" feature so as to control interest-based advertising on an iOS or Android
            mobile device by selecting the Limit Add Tracking option in the privacy section of your Settings on iOS or
            via advertising preferences on Android devices (e.g. in Google Settings). This will not prevent the display
            of advertisements but will mean that they will no longer be personalised to your interests.</span></li>
