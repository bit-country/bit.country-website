            <h2>3. Prices and Fees</h2>
            <p>3.1 NFT Sales</p>
            <p style='margin-left: 15px'>3.1.1 The Platform allows you to purchase NFTs from us or other Users in a
                Primary Sale or Secondary Sale.</p>
            <p style='margin-left: 15px'>3.1.2 Offers made by you on the Platform are legally binding, revocable offers
                to purchase an NFT, capable of immediate acceptance by us or the NFT holder (as the case may be). By
                making an offer, you agree to temporarily send and lose control over an amount of offered cryptocurrency
                to a smart contract. The smart contract may be configured to hold the offered currency until either (a)
                the offer is accepted by the seller; (b) a higher offer is received; or (c) the offer is revoked.</p>
            <p style='margin-left: 15px'>3.1.3 Upon the sale of the relevant NFT, if you are an unsuccessful bidder, the
                offered cryptocurrency will be released back to you. The Platform or the NFT holder (as the case may be)
                has the unilateral authority to accept the bid.</p>
            <p style='margin-left: 15px'>3.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, bids placed during an auction cannot be
                cancelled. Therefore, if you have won the bid, the auction transaction will be processed accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>3.2 NFT Platform Fees</p>
            <p>Unless otherwise expressly specified, the Platform shall collect up to 5% of the total sale price for the
                sale of each NFT each time (i) an NFT is sold in a Primary Sale by a User; and (ii) an NFT is
                transferred from one NFT holder to the next holder in a Secondary Sale (&ldquo;<strong><u>Platform
                        Fees</u></strong>&rdquo;). You agree to the automated collection and disbursement to the Company
                of such Platform Fees.</p>
            <p>3.3 Gas</p>
            <p>The relevant decentralized blockchain platform may require the payment of a fee
                (&ldquo;<strong><u>Gas</u></strong>&rdquo;) for every transaction that occurs on it. Unless otherwise
                expressly specified, you acknowledge and agree that you will incur the Gas in relation to each and every
                transaction associated with you via your use of the Platform. You acknowledge and agree that under no
                circumstances will a contract, agreement, offer, sale, bid, and/or other transaction on the Platform be
                invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the Gas for the given
                transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to you. You also acknowledge and agree that
                Gas is non-refundable under all circumstances.</p>
            <p>3.4 Taxes</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for determining the amount of applicable taxes for the transactions you carry
                out on the Platform and will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other
                taxes and/or duties claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with your ownership of
                any digital assets, and your use of the Platform.</p>
            <p>3.5 No Refunds</p>
            <p>All transactions on the Platform are final and all fees are non-refundable except at the sole discretion
                of the Company (for Platform Fees and other fees within its control only).</p>
            <h2>4. Eligibility, Personal Data and Security</h2>
            <p>4.1 Eligibility</p>
            <p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are more than 18 years of age, (ii) you have not been restricted
                by us in using any of the Platform, selling or purchasing any goods (including any digital assets) on
                the Platform; and (iii) you are otherwise fully able and competent to accept, abide and comply with
                these Terms of Use.</p>
            <p>4.2 Personal Data</p>
            <p>Save that we will comply with all applicable law relating to data privacy (including the Personal Data
                Protection Act 2012 of Singapore). Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to impute an obligation of
                confidentiality on us with respect to your registration information. If required by law (including a
                court order and a government or regulatory demand or requirement having the force of law), we will
                disclose such information, including but not limited to your registration information, as so ordered.

            <p>4.3 Security</p>
            <p>For security purposes, including the investigation of whether any User is using the Platform for fraud,
                money laundering, insider trading and/or other unlawful activity, we have the right, and sole
                discretion, to immediately:</p>

            <p>Where applicable, you are solely responsible for the management of your account, wallet and password(s).
                You are solely responsible for restricting access to your computer(s) and maintaining the
                confidentiality and security of your account, login details, passwords, seed phrase, and all activities
                that occur under your account. Where you have an account with us, you must notify us in writing

                disruptions remain, and the Company shall not be liable to you for any loss, damage or delay caused by
                the delay or failure of the Platform, the trading of NFTs on the Marketplace, cyber hacking, fraud or
                any form of cybercrimes committed against the Company, the Platform or you in respect of all matters.
            </p>
            <p>10.2 The regulatory status of cryptographic tokens, including cryptocurrencies, NFTs, digital tokens and
                assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. In the event that any
                relevant authority makes changes to existing laws, regulations and/or rules or financial institutions
                make commercial decisions and such changes/decisions negatively impact the provision of any services,
                the Platform, the digital tokens, or NFTs in various ways, the Company shall be entitled to cease the
                provision of any services to you and operation of the Platform in any jurisdiction without incurring any
                liability whatsoever to you.</p>
            <p>10.3 Due to the relatively nascent nature of the blockchain technology, the relevant blockchain may also
                be prone to periodic congestion, failure, or cyberattack, during which the delivery of cryptocurrencies,
                digital tokens and/or NFTs being traded or issued on the Platform may be delayed indefinitely or
                irretrievably lost or stolen due to no fault of ours. Accordingly, you acknowledge and accept that no
                liability whatsoever is assumed by us for losses or delays to you caused by any such factors.</p>
            <p>10.4 You acknowledge and accept the risks of dealing with smart contracts, losing money due to
                fluctuations in the price of digital tokens and assets (including but not limited to NFTs traded on this
                Platform).</p>
